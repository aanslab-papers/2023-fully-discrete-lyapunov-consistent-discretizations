# Fully discrete Lyapunov consistent discretizations of any order for parabolic reaction-diffusion equations with r species

> This README file

The fully-discrete Lyapunov consistent discretizations are designed for systems of parabolic reaction-diffusion equations. These discretizations preserve the stability of the equilibrium points of the continuous partial differential equations. The spatial discretization is based on summation-by-parts operators and simultaneous approximation terms for unstructured grids, while the temporal integration relies on relaxation Runge-Kutta methods. The discretizations are arbitrarily high-order accurate in space and time and can be used with h- and p-refinements. The algorithms have been successfully applied to epidemiology compartmental models for disease transmission and an oncolytic M1 virotherapy model. The source codes to simulate the susceptibleâ€“infected (SI) PDE model, susceptible-exposed-infectious (SEI) PDE model, and the Oncolytic M1 virotherapy PDE model reported in the manuscript can be found in this repository.

 **The susceptibleâ€“infected (SI) PDE model:** The contour plots presented depict the emergence of Turing patterns in populations afflicted with infections (I) when the epidemiological parameter is set at 1.14.
 
In the following, we provide the command line options of the SSDC library integrated with PETSc to execute the codes. Users can leverage these options to customize various aspects such as mesh handling, visualization, time stepping, adaptivity, and monitoring.

# Code Execution

> *Note:* The binary codes work on Linux machines, specifically Ubuntu and Fedora, that are equipped with Intel processors.

To run the codes, follow the steps below:

##  Run the Code
* Execute the command ```make run ``` to run all the codes (Susceptibleâ€“infected (SI) PDE model, Susceptible-exposed-infectious (SEI) PDE model, and Oncolytic M1 virotherapy PDE model).
* You can pass additional options to customize the behavior of the code. Refer to the options listed in the available customization options section.

###  To run this code in a stand-alone mode:

```./name-of-the-application.bin SSDC-options or YAML file containing SSDC-options``` 

 **Example 1:** 

```./model-pde-m1virus.bin -nel 32 -deg 2 -case 1 -ts_max_time 400  -rrk 1 -rrk_solver 0 -ts_adapt_dt_max 1e-10  -rrk_monitor```

 **Example 2:**

```./model-pde-m1virus.bin -options_file m1virus-D1.yml```

##  Plotting the Data

After generating the data, you can reproduce the figures of the manuscript using an IPython Notebook. To install all the necessary packages, execute the bash script `create-venv.sh`. This script will create a Python virtual environment and set up the required dependencies for plotting the figures in the notebook.

# ðŸ’¡ **Notice:**

Please note that the bash script ```build-drivers.sh``` demonstrates the compilation process for the PETSc and SSDC libraries and the drivers. It is important to mention that the SSDC library is proprietary and cannot be shared or recompiled.

However, by using the shared codes in this repository, you will be able to reproduce simulations and explore the capabilities of the SSDC library. While you cannot modify or recompile the SSDC library itself or the source codes, you have the freedom to customize various aspects of the codes using the available SSDC library options.

These options allow you to:

1. Configure the mesh according to your specific requirements.
2. Define time-stepping methods.
3. Utilize adaptivity techniques.
4. Visualize the results of your simulations.
5. Monitor the simulation.

By leveraging these options, you can tailor the behavior of the SSDC library to suit your needs and explore its full potential while working with the provided shared codes.
