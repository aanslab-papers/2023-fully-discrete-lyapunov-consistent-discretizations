# Fully discrete Lyapunov consistent discretizations of any order for parabolic reaction-diffusion equations with r species

> This README file

The fully-discrete Lyapunov consistent discretizations are designed for systems of parabolic reaction-diffusion equations. These discretizations preserve the stability of the equilibrium points of the continuous partial differential equations. The spatial discretization is based on summation-by-parts operators and simultaneous approximation terms for unstructured grids, while the temporal integration relies on relaxation Runge-Kutta methods. The discretizations are arbitrarily high-order accurate in space and time and can be used with h- and p-refinements. The algorithms have been successfully applied to epidemiology compartmental models for disease transmission and an oncolytic M1 virotherapy model. The source codes to simulate the susceptible‚Äìinfected (SI) PDE model, susceptible-exposed-infectious (SEI) PDE model, and the Oncolytic M1 virotherapy PDE model reported in the manuscript can be found in this repository.

In the following, we provide the command line options of the SSDC library integrated with PETSc to execute the codes. Users can leverage these options to customize various aspects such as mesh handling, visualization, time stepping, adaptivity, and monitoring.

# Code Execution

To run the codes, follow the steps below:

## ü§ñ Run the Code
* Execute the command ```make run ``` to run all the codes (Susceptible‚Äìinfected (SI) PDE model, Susceptible-exposed-infectious (SEI) PDE model, and Oncolytic M1 virotherapy PDE model).
* You can pass additional options to customize the behavior of the code. Refer to the options listed in the available customization options section.

### ü§ì To run this code in a stand-alone mode:

```./name-of-the-application.bin SSDC-options or YAML file containing SSDC-options``` 

üóíÔ∏è **Example 1:** 

```./model-pde-m1virus.bin -nel 32 -deg 2 -case 1 -ts_max_time 400  -rrk 1 -rrk_solver 0 -ts_adapt_dt_max 1e-10  -rrk_monitor```

## üé® Plotting the Data

After generating the data, you can reproduce the figures of the manuscript using an IPython Notebook. To install all the necessary packages, execute the bash script `create-venv.sh`. This script will create a Python virtual environment and set up the required dependencies for plotting the figures in the notebook.

# üí° **Notice:**

The SSDC library is a proprietary software package. The library is the intellectual property of King Abdullah University of Science and Technology (KAUST) and is owned by the institution. It is licensed and developed in collaboration with several industry partners. Therefore, it cannot be shared, copied, or distributed.

However, as part of the manuscript review process, we have provided you with the source codes and binary codes required to simulate the susceptible‚Äìinfected (SI) PDE model, the susceptible-exposed-infectious (SEI) PDE model, and the oncolytic M1 virotherapy PDE model reported in the manuscript.

Users can customize various aspects of the library by utilizing the available SSDC library options. These options enable you to adjust the problem's dimensionality (1D, 2D, or 3D), configure the mesh, define time-stepping approaches, use adaptivity, visualize the results, and monitor the simulation progress.
